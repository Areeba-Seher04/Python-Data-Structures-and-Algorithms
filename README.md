# Hashing Data Structure

Hashing is an important Data Structure which is designed to use a special function called the Hash function which is used to map a given value with a particular key for faster access of elements. The efficiency of mapping depends of the efficiency of the hash function used.

## Collision Resolution
Quadratic Probing is used here to resolve collision.
